      "The student presents information solely from one source without attempting to integrate it with other sources.",
      "The student attempts to use multiple sources but shows no connection between them.",
      "The student mentions multiple sources, but the information is presented separately without integration.",
      "The student integrates information from at least two sources to support their claims.",
      "The student effectively integrates information from various sources (text, media, visual displays) to support their claims and clarify their findings.",
      "The student masterfully integrates information from a wide range of sources, synthesizing the information to create a coherent and insightful explanation."
