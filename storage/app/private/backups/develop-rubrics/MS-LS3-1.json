      "No model is presented, or the model is completely irrelevant to the concept.",
      "The model is rudimentary and lacks essential components. It shows a minimal understanding of the relationship between genes, mutations, and proteins.",
      "The model includes some relevant components, but contains inaccuracies or omissions that significantly impact its ability to explain the effects of mutations.",
      "The model is generally accurate but may lack detail or clarity in some areas. It adequately represents the relationship between genes, mutations, and proteins.",
      "The model is accurate, detailed, and clearly represents the relationship between genes, mutations, and proteins. It effectively illustrates how changes to genes can affect the structure and function of organisms.",
      "The model is exceptionally clear, accurate, and insightful. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the relationship between genes, mutations, and proteins and provides nuanced explanations of the potential effects on organisms, including harmful, beneficial, and neutral outcomes."

      "The explanation is missing or completely incorrect.",
      "The explanation provides a vague or inaccurate description of how mutations may affect proteins and organismal traits.",
      "The explanation identifies some potential effects of mutations but lacks depth or clarity.",
      "The explanation describes how mutations may affect protein structure and function, and how this, in turn, can impact organismal traits. It includes some examples or generalizations to support the explanation.",
      "The explanation clearly articulates how mutations can lead to changes in proteins, which can result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects on the structure and function of the organism.",
      "The explanation provides a comprehensive and insightful analysis of how mutations can lead to changes in proteins and the resulting spectrum of effects (harmful, beneficial, neutral) on the organism. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the underlying mechanisms and provides relevant examples."

      "The real-world example is inappropriate or inaccurate.",
      "Real-world examples are connected correctly, but no explanation is made to how this exemplifies mutations.",
      "The real-world example given exemplifies mutations, but the link to the model is weak.",
      "A concrete real-world example is given and properly connected to the model provided."
