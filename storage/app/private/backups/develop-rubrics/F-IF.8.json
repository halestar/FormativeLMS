      "Does not attempt to rewrite the function or demonstrates no understanding of equivalent forms.",

      "Demonstrates a sophisticated understanding by rewriting the function and providing insightful explanations of the connections between different forms and their implications for understanding the function\u2019s behavior. Can generalize key feature properties and extrapolate to different function types."

      "Clearly explains the relationship between the algebraic forms and the graph, and can identify key features from both representations.",
