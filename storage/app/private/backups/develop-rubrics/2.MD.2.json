      "Measurements are reasonably accurate, with minor errors that do not significantly impact the overall understanding.",
      "Measurements are accurate and demonstrate a good understanding of using standard units.",
      "Measurements are precise and accurate, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the properties and usage of standard units."

      "No recognition that different length units will produce different measurements.",
      "Attempts to measure using 2 different length units, but no attempt to relate the number of measurements to the size of the unit used.",
      "The number of measurement when using 2 different length units are correctly identified, but no reasonable relationship is established between them.",
      "The student can describe the general relationship between the number of measurements with different length units, but not precise. Ex: 'the bigger the unit, the smaller the number of measurements needed'.",
      "The student can describe the precise relationship between the number of measurements with different length units. Ex: 'If the first unit is twice as big, then the number of measurements will be approximately half of the second unit'.",
      "The student can describe the precise relationship between the number of measurements with different length units and provide clear and accurate reasoning about the number of measurements."
