      "No attempt to gather or synthesize information about sensory receptors and their function.",
      "Limited attempt to gather information; synthesis is lacking or inaccurate. Shows minimal understanding of sensory receptors.",
      "Gathers information from a limited range of sources. Synthesis is basic, with some inaccuracies in understanding sensory receptor function.",
      "Gathers information from multiple sources, demonstrating a satisfactory synthesis. Understands the basic function of sensory receptors and their role in transmitting information.",
      "Gathers information from a variety of sources and effectively synthesizes it to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of how sensory receptors respond to stimuli.",
      "Gathers and expertly synthesizes information from diverse and credible sources. Demonstrates a deep and nuanced understanding of sensory receptors, their function, and their role in behavior and memory."
