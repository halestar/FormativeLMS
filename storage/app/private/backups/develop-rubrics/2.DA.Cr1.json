      "No exploration of stimuli or generation of movement ideas is evident.",
      "Minimal exploration of stimuli; few movement ideas are suggested, lacking connection to the stimuli.",
      "Limited exploration of stimuli; some movement ideas are suggested, but the connection to stimuli is superficial.",
      "Adequate exploration of stimuli; movement ideas are suggested with a visible connection to the source material.",
      "Thorough exploration of stimuli; movement ideas are clearly connected to the source material and show creative interpretation.",
      "In-depth and imaginative exploration of stimuli; movement ideas are innovative, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding and transformation of the source material."

      "No combination of movements or manipulation of dance elements is demonstrated.",
      "Minimal combination of movements; little to no manipulation of dance elements is apparent.",
      "Limited combination of movements; basic manipulation of a few dance elements is attempted, but lacks finesse.",
      "Adequate combination of movements; satisfactory manipulation of dance elements is demonstrated, showing some understanding of their potential.",
      "Skillful combination of a variety of movements; effective manipulation of multiple dance elements enhances the expressiveness of the movements.",
      "Masterful combination of diverse movements; sophisticated and inventive manipulation of dance elements creates a compelling and original choreographic statement."
